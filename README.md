   * AI Fundamentals     

## Python Fundaments:

1. ### **Basic Python Syntax & Programming Concepts**
   
  * Variables, data types (int, float, string, bool)
  * Control flow (if-else statements, loops)
  * Functions and scope
  * List comprehensions and lambda functions

2. ### **Data Structures**

  * Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
  * Understanding how to manipulate and iterate over these structures efficiently

3. ### **Working with Libraries**

  * Installing and importing libraries with pip
  * Understanding and using packages like numpy, pandas, matplotlib

4. ### **File Handling**

  * Reading/writing CSV, JSON, Excel files
  * Working with datasets for ML workflows

5. ### **Functions and Modules**

  * Writing reusable code with functions
  * Understanding Python modules and packages
  * Importing your own modules

6. ### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics**

  * Classes and objects
  * Attributes and methods
  * Inheritance and polymorphism (basic understanding)

7. ### **Exception Handling**

  * Try-except blocks for error management
  * Ensuring code robustness

## Python Frameworks for ML Models:

1. ### **Numpy**

  * Arrays and matrices
  * Vectorized operations for efficient numerical computations
  * Broadcasting rules

2. ### **Pandas**

  * DataFrames and Series
  * Data cleaning, filtering, and transformation
  * Handling missing data
  * Grouping and aggregation

3. ### **Data Visualization**

  * Plotting with Matplotlib and Seaborn
  * Understanding different types of plots: line, scatter, bar, histogram, heatmaps

4. ### **TensorFlow**

  * Developed by Google, it's one of the most popular open-source libraries for machine learning and deep learning.
  * Supports both high-level APIs (like Keras) and low-level custom model building.
  * Good for production-scale ML and deployment.

5. ### **PyTorch**

  * Developed by Facebookâ€™s AI Research lab.
  * Known for its dynamic computation graph, making it highly flexible and intuitive.
  * Widely used in research and production.
