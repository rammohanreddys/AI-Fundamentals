# NumPy Basics

## **What is NumPy?**

**NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library for:**

* Working with arrays (especially multidimensional arrays).
* Performing fast mathematical operations.
* Supporting tools for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, random numbers, etc. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
* The core of the library is the ndarray object, which is a fast and memory-efficient way to handle numerical data.
* NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.

**Import NumPy:**

Once NumPy is installed, import it in your applications by adding the import keyword:
```
import numpy
```

**Example:**
```
import numpy
arry = numpy.array([1,2,3,4,5])
print(arry)
print(type(arry))
```
**Output:**
